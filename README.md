# overspill-forum
A Reddit-like news aggregation forum we created for our case study.

## Roadmap

1. Accounts Management
2. Group management
   - Overspill will provide a system for grouping topics known as **Spillcatchers**
   - It will be moderated by users
3. Collections management
   - Users will be able to group Spillcatchers into collections where they see an overview of posts from Spillcatchers they included in that collection
